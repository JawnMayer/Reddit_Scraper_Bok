# Reddit_Scraper_Bok

Reddit scraper which scrapes headlines of reddit posts and does sentiment analysis on them then uploads them to a .csv file based on a positive or negative rating.

This is taken from the youtube video shared in zoom. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZhog5C3bU&t=1s

Take the Only Title file and copy and paste then put in your keys. Then run it.


To create an app go to reddit.com/prefs/apps then create an app. Name it then select the script bubble.
For redirect url put http://localhost:8080 and everything else can be blank.


I also included the csv files with headlines that I got. You can use these in excel.

This was done in JupyterLab which is done in the pycharm terminal by 

pip install jupyterlab

then typing jupyterlab
